sumcoin-segwit-payments
=================

## Source : https://github.com/sumcoinlabs/sumcoin

Library to assist in payment processing on Sumcoin. It first allows for generation
of address according to the [BIP44 standard](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki).

[Bitcoin-js](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib) is used for  deterministic public and private keys.
Please see the BIP32 standard for more information ([BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki)).

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install --save sumcoin-segwit-payments
```

Create a new wallet (DON'T DO THIS ON PRODUCTION):
```js
let segwitPayments = require('sumcoin-segwit-payments')()
let keys = segwitPayments.generateNewKeys('really random entropy here')
console.log(keys.xpub)
console.log(keys.xprv)
```

Generate an segwit deposit address from a public seed (xpub).
This is useful if you are a hot wallet and don't store the private key. You will need
to keep track of which path node you are on (increasing INT):
```js
let depositAddress = segwitPayments.bip44(keys.xpub, 1234) // for path m/49'/2'/0'/0/1234
console.log(depositAddress)
```

Get the private key for an address on a specific path:
```js
let privateKey = segwitPayments.getPrivateKey(keys.xprv, 1234) // for path m/49'/2'/0'/0/1234
```

Get the public key from a private key:
```js
let address = segwitPayments.privateToPublic(privateKey) // for path m/49'/2'/0'/0/1234
if(address === depositAddress){
  console.log('this library works')
} else {
  console.log('better not use this library')
}
```

Get the derived xpub key from a hardened private key:
```js
let xpub = segwitPayments.getXpubFromXprv(xprv) // for path m/49'/2'/0'/0/1234
```





**Note:** It is suggested to generate your Private key offline with FAR more entropy than the default function, then use getXpubFromXprv.
You have been warned!
